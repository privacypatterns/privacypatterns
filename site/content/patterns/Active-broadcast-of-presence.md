<!--### [Also Known As]-->
<!-- All other names the pattern is known by.-->



## Summary
<!-- One short paragraph summarising the pattern.-->

Users may choose actively when they want to share presence information, to increase both the relevance of, and control over, sharing.

<!--intent-->
Enable sharing of location or presence data where the user controls the timing and context.

Supports [user control](User-control) and [appropriateness](Appropriateness).

## Context
<!-- The situations in which the pattern may apply.-->

When a user wants to share or broadcast location or other presence data that is contextually relevant and a full stream of data may be either noisy or intrusive.

## Problem
<!-- The problem a pattern addresses, including a list of forces describing why a problem might be difficult to solve.-->

How can a system broadcast a user's presence or location information to a social network without revealing sensitive locations or location histories or overwhelming recipients with noisy data?

<!--forces/concerns-->
Always requiring active decision-making can burden the user with choices.

## Solution
<!-- A concise description of how the pattern addresses the problem.-->

While sharing access controls may allow constant access, only _broadcast_ presence information at the active choice of the user.
