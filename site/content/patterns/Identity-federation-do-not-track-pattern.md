## Summary
<!-- One short paragraph summarising the pattern.-->

All information has been extracted from
http://blog.beejones.net/the-identity-federation-do-not-track-pattern

The Do Not Track Pattern makes sure that neither the Identity Provider
nor the Identity Broker can learn the relationship between the user
and the Service Providers the user us.

## Context
<!-- The situations in which the pattern may apply.-->

This pattern is focused on identity federation models

## Problem
<!-- The problem a pattern addresses, including a list of forces describing why a problem might be difficult to solve.-->

When an identity system provides identifying information about a user
and passes this to a third party service, different parties can do
correlation and derive additional information.

## Solution
<!-- A concise description of how the pattern addresses the problem.-->

Include an orchestrator component, that must act in behalf and be
controlled by the user. The orchestrator makes sure that the identity
broker can’t correlate the original request from the service provider
with the assertions that are returned from the identity provider. The
correlation can only be done within the orchestrator but that’s no
issue because this acts on behalf of the user, possibly on the device
of the user.

<!--goals-->
Avoid the correlation of end user and service provider data
