If the password is stolen by a\nmalicious party through some means, it can be reused until it is\u00a0changed.The password can be\u00a0cracked.Many account owners tend to use weak passwords that can be\nbrute-force attacked online. Sometimes the hacker can obtain the\ndatabase dump which contains hashed passwords, which can be\nbrute-forced\u00a0offline.The account owner has no way to ensure their exclusive possession of\n    the\u00a0password.The account owner has no evidence if the password is stolen by a\nmalicious\u00a0party.The only way to control who can access is to reset the\u00a0password.As a result, if the account owner want to ensure only they have the\npassword, they can only reset the password. In some scenarios,\nresetting the password is not\u00a0enough.The password can be seen by people\u00a0around.When the account owner enters the password on a computer keyboard or\nthe screen of a mobile device (mobile phone / tablet), people around\nhave the ability to snoop the password and record\u00a0it.Thus, a service can't tell if the user is legitimate even if the\nidentity-password combination provided by the user is correct.\nFortunately, a service can usually receive some meta information to help\ndetermine if an activity is unusual. In case of such unusual activities,\na service needs to prevent suspicious access to an account, and/or\ninform the account owner of the unusual\u00a0activities.How can a service that uses username-password authentication and\ninvolves a lot of privacy identify unusual sign-ins, confirm the\nidentify of the user, and inform the account owner of such unusual\u00a0activities?The pattern described here is a tradeoff between pure password\nauthentication which is insecure, and pure multi-factor authentication\nwhich is inconvenient. It increases privacy at the cost of\u00a0usability.The fallback multi-factor authentication should be picked carefully with\nthe understanding of the\u00a0service.The strategy to identify unusual activities should also be considered\nseriously. It should be also to identify most of the activities, with a\nfalse positive rate that is not too high. It should balance the cost of\nmulti-factor\u00a0authentication.First, the service should be able to identify unusual sign-ins. Then the\nservice may use multi-factor authentication to confirm the identity of\nthe\u00a0user.The user should be informed of unusual activities, or have some ways to\nsee recent events, and even do\u00a0something.Today, a web service may appear as a website or an application on the\nuser's devices (including mobile devices and the PCs). The service can\nuse meta information to determine if a sign-in with the correct\nusername-password combination is\u00a0suspicious.The strategies described here has both false positives and false\u00a0negatives.By running native code, the application can collect some identifiers of\nthe machine, including the operating system environment settings (e.g.\nthe list of running processes), the hardware parameters (such as the ID\nof the CPU), and device UUIDs (provided by mobile operating systems like\niOS). By completing a network request, the service also retrieves the IP\naddress of the\u00a0machine.In case of a suspicious sign-in, multi-factor authentication may be a\nway to let the legitimate user in. The service can request one more\nauthentication except password, such\u00a0as:A software\u00a0tokenExamples include Google Authenticator which runs on mobile phones\nand implements RFC6238 TOTP security\u00a0tokens..A hardware token\u00a0(disconnected)Examples include a token issued by a bank which displays digits,\nwhich is similar to a software\u00a0token.A hardware token\u00a0(connected)The token may exchange a longer secondary password than the previous\none, which means it's\u00a0safer.Personal data like date of birth,\u00a0SSNObviously not a good choice here because it cannot be\u00a0changed.An one-time password (OTP) sent to the registered E-mail address /\n    mobile\u00a0phoneDepending the type of the service, maybe the user uses the same\npassword for the E-mail address, or maybe the mobile phone is stolen\nand the service runs on the mobile\u00a0phone.Using multi-factor authentication only in case of suspicious sign-ins is\nmore convenient to using it all the time, but is less\u00a0secure.When an suspicious sign-in is detected, it may be a sign that the\npassword has already been leaked. Depending on the type of the service,\nit can notify the user about the suspicious sign-in through E-mail,\ntelephone, or other\u00a0means.Here the immediate notification can also be used in the multi-factor\u00a0authentication.For services that can be logged on from multiple devices at the same\ntime, the user should be able to check the existence of other sessions,\nand review recent sign-in\u00a0events.This pattern has some limitations. For example, it relies on accurate\nidentification of suspicious sign-ins based on meta information, where\nthe meta information including the IP address can be spoofed by an\nexperienced\u00a0attacker.If the fallback multi-factor authentication only happens occasionally to\nthe legitimate account owner, they may be unprepared to such\nauthentication, leading to a decreased\u00a0usability.Gmail displays information about other sessions (if any) in the footer,\n   linking to a page named \"Activity on this account\" which lists other\n   sessions and recent activities to the Gmail account. The user has the\n   option to sign out other\u00a0sessions.In case of annoying false positives, the user may choose to disable the\n   alert for unusual activity. The disable takes about a week, \"to make\n   sure the bad guys aren't the ones who turned off your\u00a0alerts.\"It also displays all devices that are linked to the account, and allows\n   the user to unlink one or more of\u00a0them.I started with Gmail's display of account activities. It displays\nunusual activities regarding an account, which involves identifying\nunusual activities where the password entered is correct. For some other\nservices, correct passwords can be rejected from a new device /\u00a0location.So, the scope of this pattern is to handle unusual activities (including\u00a0sign-ins).This pattern includes multi-factor authentication and two-step\nauthentication, which are well studied.

However, these measurements may reveal further information (e.g. personal habits, etc.) when repeated over\u00a0time.A noise value is added to the true, measured value before it is transmitted to the service provider, so as to obfuscate it. The noise abides by a previously known distribution, so that the best estimation for the result of adding several measurements can be computed, while an adversary would not be able to infer the real value of any individual measurement. Note that the noise needs not be either additive or Gaussian. In fact, these may not be useful for privacy-oriented obfuscation. Scaling noise and additive Laplacian noise have proved more useful for privacy\u00a0preservation.A service provider can get reliable measurements of service attributes to fulfil its operating requirements; however, no additional personal information can be inferred from the aggregation of several measurements coming from the same\u00a0user.The pattern applies to any scenario where the use of a resource over time is being monitored (e.g. smart grid, cloud computing).

The utility employs that information to both adapt the power distribution in a dynamic fashion, according to user demand at each moment, and bill the each client periodically, according to his aggregated consumption over the billing period. However, this information can also be exploited to infer sensitive user information (e.g. at what time he or she leaves and comes back to home,\u00a0etc.)", "tags": "", "title": "Added-noise measurement obfuscation"},{"url": "/patterns/Lawful-Consent", "text": "This pattern covers in detail the legal and social obligations surrounding a data subject's consent to processing of their data in specific circumstances. Every use of the subject's personal data should be covered by an explicit agreement in which the data subject was made aware of the implications of their\u00a0consent.Where data controllers (e.g. organisations) aim to provide a service (or product) to users, there may be opportunities to reuse data, gather feedback, or make use of user data to further their system's value. Many controllers seek to continually collect and utilise this data, often in ways which warrant privacy concerns. For any data processing (including collection), controllers should first obtain consent from the users in\u00a0question.There are social norms surrounding the use of personal data which need to be adhered to if an controller wishes to avoid scrutiny. Users do not inherently trust controllers to handle their personal data with care for privacy. Without clearly defined boundaries, these users may have justifiable concerns about what is learned about them, and how this information may be used. Additionally, various jurisdictions supply varying compliance requirements, and these controllers need to cater to every market they provide\u00a0to.Doing otherwise, possibly by disinterest or negligence, may have financial consequences in addition to potential public outcry. Despite this, controllers regularly consider the impact that their decisions may have on competitive edge and resulting profits. The link between better decision making, possibly less sharing, and reduced monetary gains sways some controllers into unlawful forms of\u00a0consent.An controller aims to maximise the value of their services by gathering as much sharing and participation as possible, potentially seeing user consent as a barrier to functionality and efficiency. They may inadvertently subvert notions of consent by unnecessarily bundling together desirable services with needs for personal information, or downplaying the significance of the data involved. They undermine self-determination at the risk of losing trust from their users, and attracting legal investigations which may rule their practices\u00a0unlawful.A user should be given every opportunity to assess their sharing choices prior to making their consent. The controller should aid the user in comprehending the tradeoffs apparent in using each of their services, without over-burdening the user. These consented services should be purposed-separated, so that users may make use of functionality without first granting unnecessary\u00a0consent.Services should be separated into distinct processes for which distinct consent is acquired. Each purpose requires its own consent. These permissions need to be given subsequent to ascertaining sufficient awareness in the user about the consequences of that\u00a0consent.The users should not be pressured into providing consent. Instead, the benefits may be presented along with the trade-offs so that the users may make an informed decision. Some users are not necessarily capable of making these decisions themselves (e.g. children) and thus provisions need to be made to cater to this. The provided information should not be misleading, as coerced consent is not a valid form of permission. One way to present policies in an accessible manner is through comparative examples (e.g. in addition to further detail, what is unique about our privacy\u00a0policy?).In more personal services (i.e. one-on-one), personal privacy policies may undergo a formal negotiation. As opposed to user preferences (both at sign-up and through appropriate defaults), understanding a user's personal privacy requirements may benefit from the facilitation of a human representative. This, however, suffers from it's own drawbacks where the representative may misunderstand the user's requirements. Even in interpersonal exchanges, controllers should err on the side of caution. Where available, explicit signing of an agreement aids in proving\u00a0consent.With the ability to choose exactly what tradeoffs are agreeable to them, users will be more content, and trusting of the system. They may as a result use more services, and participate more than they otherwise would. Being aware of what information is actually needed to perform certain functionality may also prevent its use, but rightfully so as to prevent\u00a0backlash.The need for certain information for some services will bring inappropriate business processes to the foreground to be rectified, or otherwise questioned. This will likely bring the controller towards better practices, and may affect others as well. Once the public sees the controller's willingness to cooperate, trust will grow even\u00a0further.Overall adoption will grow for controllers who are shown to be trustworthy and upfront about their data processing practices. This may very well offset the costs involved in maintaining\u00a0transparency.Allowing informed and specific consent prevents controllers from soliciting misplaced consent, which greatly reduces the adoption of invasive services. These are often the most profitable\u00a0services.Explicit Consent / Obtaining Explicit consent via privacy agreement / Permission to Use Sensitive Data via Privacy Agreement / Sign an Agreement to Solve Lack of Trust on the Use of Private Data\u00a0ContextArticle 29 Data Protection Working Party.

When users want to share (and enable re-sharing of) these resources, they may wish to do so privately using existing communication mechanisms. This is particularly relevant when users are sharing with contacts who would rather not, or cannot, simply\u00a0authenticate.Users want to share a private resource with unauthenticated users in a way that respects the sensitivity of that resource.\nThe solution must not allow users to access resources that weren't intended to be shared, nor publicize the location of the intended resource to unintended\u00a0recipients.Note that the URL will be retained in recipients' browser history and could easily be inadvertently shared with others. Services should help users understand these\u00a0limitations.Services may allow users to revoke existing private links or change the URL to effectively re-set who can access the resource. Additionally, users may set a time-limit for the resource's validity, or have it invalidated upon\u00a0modification.The controller allows their users' online resources to be shared by publishing an unlisted URL with a complex, long, and randomly generated string. This can be part of a query string as opposed to an on disk location. In this case, the preprocessor intercepts the query and redirects the user to the correct resource. This may be an actual file on disk (probably not served by direct link), generated on the fly, or extracted from a database or compressed file. The preprocessor can verify validity dynamically before serving the\u00a0resource.The situation in which the user has a direct link to the resource location is not ideal, however, as it will need to change in the event of a time or version restriction since access to the file is not controlled by the\u00a0preprocessor.Based\u00a0on:", "tags": "", "title": "Private link"},{"url": "/patterns/Privacy-aware-network-client", "text": "A privacy policy which is hard to understand is in an automated way\nconverted into a more easy to read\u00a0format.This pattern is limited to the web browsing\u00a0domain.Many websites have privacy policies which are hard to understand for\nthe general\u00a0audience.Many people enter websites with different intentions like shopping,\nresearch, etc. At the same time those responsible collect, use and\nrelease information about a user by explaining it through statements\ncalled privacy policies.

The sensitivity of this information raises concern and garners a need for special care. The storage medium in this case rules out typical security\u00a0approaches.Effective distributed storage services require specialized privacy management. The deficiencies of traditional means may be expressed through the following:\n- traditional security mechanisms are platform dependent;\n- typically they are difficult to federate or distribute;\n- compliance with protocol can be cumbersome; and\n- as such they are often\u00a0inflexible.Single Point of Contact\u00a0adopts a claim-based approach for both authentication and authorization similar to a super-peer design, also acting as a (Resource) Security Token Service, an Identity and Attribute Provider, and a Relying Party.

SPoC additionally facilitates secure e-Health service development and integration. It is able to share Electronic Health Records (EHRs) through a peer-to-peer network as an overarching, claim-based, super-peer-like representative of the e-Health community. Multiple SPoCs may also communicate, constituting a Circle of\u00a0Trust.See Fan et al.

When in a Circle of Trust, the SPoC can also translate the claims of other SPoCs as a Resource\u00a0STS.SPoCs' implementation of e-consent features the following levels, based on Coiera et al.

A user may not realize that an application given permission to access location is doing so continuously or repeatedly, or may not remember that explicit permissions given in the past allow a service to access data again later.

That is, a place where users may, granularly or in bulk, define who may access location information of their\u00a0content.A basic solution could feature an interface or control for selecting the allowed users from all the types of users of the socially oriented service (e.g. built-in or user-defined groups, individuals, or anonymous users). This control could apply to individual content, or to multiple selections, or\u00a0groups.If a user chooses, certain individuals or groups may have default access to the attached location information. Default access like this, however, invalidates the following\u00a0approach.An extended solution may aim to be further privacy\u00a0preserving.The service may accept ciphertext as the location coupled with the content.

Sometimes this is sensitive, identifying, or just metadata or other information which may be correlated to become more invasive. This nonetheless enables them to offer competitive features and\u00a0functionality.However, controllers are required to obtain unambiguous consent from their users in order to process their personal data in any way. Depending on the legal jurisdiction, there are additional considerations to take into account depending on the type of data in question. Typically, sensitive data requires especially rigorous\u00a0care.Controllers which aim to make use of user data, especially that which can be used to identify the user or sensitive aspects about the user, may not do so without a legally binding and sound acquisition of the user's\u00a0consent.The controller must ensure each user's sufficient understanding of the potential consequences. Otherwise the consent might not be informed. They must verify their users' willingness despite those consequences to provide their data for the specific purposes they need. If they do not, the consent might not be freely\u00a0given.Ensuring that users do not consent based on time constraints, or the intimidation of the information provided, may require testing with a sample. If the sample is representative, it will give the controller a defense against any claims of\u00a0coercion.The mechanism used for users to signify their consent should be clear. For example, if it is a button, it could read \"I\u00a0consent.\"Controllers can derive clearer potential consequences when the data collected is the same for every consenting user. Users therefore can look over these risks and spend less time making a valid decision.

The notification process in turn may not work correctly, so it has to be\u00a0monitored.A monitoring system logs access to clients' PII along with a time-stamp. A notification process continuously verifies that only authorized access is listed in this log file, and in case of unauthorized access notifies the data owner and logs the notification action in the log file, again accompanied by a time-stamp. A notification monitoring process finally continuously checks that t_n - t_l <= max_np (t_n denoting the time of notification, t_l the time of data leakage, max_np the maximally allowed period of notification). In case t_n - t_l > max_np it alerts the PII Incident\u00a0Manager.The pattern goal is to constantly ensure a minimum delay of notification, should a data breach have occurred, and in case a notification exceeds the allowed delay, to indicate this by appropriate\u00a0means.In order to use the pattern, the personal data processor must have in place an access control mechanism and a monitoring mechanism that allows to monitor every PII access. The pattern cannot ensure that a PII Incident Manager will take adequate actions, hence this process has to be established and controlled by other\u00a0means.Assume a company Comp stores all employees' data with a storage service Store. There is a contractual agreement between Comp and Store that each data leakage is reported within one hour. Now Bob, an employee of Store and not authorized to read Comp's data, succeeds in circumventing Store's access control mechanisms and reads Store's data. This represents a data breach of which Comp has to be notified within an\u00a0hour.This pattern is based on the privacy principle \"Accountability\" specified in ISO/IEC 29100 that is also used in Annex A of ISO/IEC 27018.

Collecting more information than is necessary can harm the user's privacy and increase the risk for the service (in the case of a security breach, for example), but location data may still need to be collected to provide the service. Similarly, users may want the advantages of sharing their location from your service to friends or to some other service, but sharing very precise information provides a much greater risk to users (of re-identification, stalking, physical intrusion,\u00a0etc.).Accepting or transmitting location data at different levels of granularity generally requires a location hierarchy or geographic ontology agreed upon by both services and a more complex data storage model than simple digital\u00a0coordinates.  Truncating latitude and longitude coordinates to a certain number of decimal places may decrease precision, but is generally not considered a good fuzzing algorithm. (For example, if a user is moving in a straight line and regularly updating their location, truncated location information will occasionally reveal precise location when the user crosses a lat/lon boundary.) Similarly, using \"town\" rather than lat/lon may occasionally reveal more precise data than expected when the user crosses a border between two\u00a0towns.Fire Eagle specifically requires that recipient applications be written to handle data at any of the levels, and allows updating the user's location at any level of\u00a0granularity.One of the fore-runners to the W3C Geolocation API, Firefox's experimental Geode feature allowed JavaScript access to the current location at four different levels of\u00a0granularity.", "tags": "", "title": "Location Granularity"},{"url": "/patterns/Incentivized-Participation", "text": "Reciprocity / Fair distribution of efforts / Win-win situation /\u00a0Pay-BackUsers of a system have varying privacy concerns, and different sensitivities associated with their personal information. These users need ways to contribute without leaking sensitive details, or to perceive a worthwhile tradeoff for those details. This can be achieved through social encouragement (i.e. participation and shared trust), direct value exchanges (discounts and giveaways), or some other derived value (e.g. positive\u00a0reinforcement).A data controller derives various values from the participation of its users (i.e. data subjects). The more that these users participate, explicitly providing context and implicitly providing metadata (e.g. statistics and telemetry), the better the controller fares in a number of respects. Despite this key relation, over-sharing can greatly infringe upon a user's right to privacy. Many controllers therefore aim to respect this right when benefiting from user\u00a0interactions.Controllers which gain from user activity want to push for participation, but this can negatively affect\u00a0users.Users have varying degrees of concern about their privacy, and do not respond to different forms of encouragement the same way. By penalising under-sharing and inactivity, or being misleading, users become alienated and distrusting of the system. As such this problem has multiple elements. These include asymmetric returns on investment, and the standard incentive deficiency, where users lack the encouragement to\u00a0participate.In many situations, some benefit more than others. In extreme cases, users may benefit through minimal participation and thus contribute very little to the system's derived value. Those who do not perceive an acceptable value despite considerable contribution may then\u00a0withdraw.An example of this behaviour might be seen in dating sites where users with only a flattering picture may succeed more than those with detailed profiles. Similar cases can be made for other social media, as well as with asymmetric bandwidth on peer to peer sharing. With torrent technologies, this is often referred to as\u00a0'leeching'.Users which provide limited or vague information due to privacy concerns may have less opportunity for participation. Another way this occurs is when they are not driven by positive social reinforcement. The lack of friends, followers, potential matches, etc. leads to user\u00a0inactivity.Privacy concerns need to be met with valid reassurances about issues which matter to the user. Firstly, users should know that the system holds their preferences in high regard. Secondly, they should perceive real value in their participation. Finally, if desired, users should be assisted in a smooth transition into the\u00a0ecosystem.The three elements of the solution are elaborated on in the following\u00a0sections.Users need to know they are able to participate without the system undermining their personal preferences. This should apply from the very first usage of a system. Everything the system does globally must adhere to privacy friendly defaults. Any service which cannot uphold these expectations should be deactivated for new users, and only be enabled once these users consent to the additional processing. Attempts to solicit this should not be\u00a0invasive.With privacy concerns at ease, encouraging equal participation entails reciprocity. These can be in both social and financial\u00a0forms.All participation should result in value derivation (social or otherwise) for all participants, and not just individuals. As a consequence of this mindset, the derived benefits of users who do not participate are limited. This secondary effect may also be the primary mechanism for reciprocity, though positive sum approaches will be met with more\u00a0support.As an additional measure, or where equality is not feasible, provide an alternative incentive. If not social, then financial incentives (discounts, waived fees) can be provided to active users. This can be limited to those who the system can identify as receiving poor value returns on their contributions. User retention examples tend to be less frequent, with the odd website sending 'come back' emails which promise fee\u00a0reductions.Another approach is the explicit provision of virtual currency necessary to benefit from the system, those who contribute will then have more currency at their disposal. They may opt to be applauded for their efforts publicly, but again should not be forced\u00a0to.Examples of social value perception are the Facebook like/reaction, Google's +1, Reddit Gold, and Twitter's reposting. These approaches are enacted by the users instead of the system, and are therefore less\u00a0intrusive.In terms of computer aided pairing, greater participation may be achieved if users consent to intelligent nudging. Sh\u00fcmmer suggests that users are more likely to participate when their interests are shared with others, and thus, a system would help users identify those with similar interests. This is another solution which relies on prior consent, however. By encouraging interaction between these users, a system would derive more activity and therefore further\u00a0value.On the other hand, Sh\u00fcmmer points out that mixing dissimilar users may also result in unexpected activity. It may allow the system to discover notions about its users which were not previously apparent. This is yet another way to increase value, though will likely be far more intrusive than the former. Users should be properly informed of the possible consequences of 'mixing it\u00a0up'.In order to ensure that recommendations made by the system do not have increasingly negative side effects, the system should learn from ineffective suggestions. This is limited to where it has permission to do so. Where user activity drops, a system should aim not continue in the same fashion as before. When it climbs, however, the system should improve whatever characteristics likely resulted in that\u00a0climb.This can be made more explicit by soliciting feedback from the user themselves, as also suggested by Sh\u00fcmmer. Even this, though, is subject to negative reactions. However, acclimating users to an environment of openness and transparency will also build trust - potentially resulting in the use of services users would not have used\u00a0otherwise.Applying the concepts represented in this pattern may have certain trade-offs\u00a0associated.Isolating users, and learning from their actions, based on feedback loops requires prior informed and explicit consent, as potentially invasive conclusions may be\u00a0derivedPermission restricted Buddy Lists in Instant Messaging, or more extensive social networks; Allowing users to filter their sharing by access groups which they\u00a0define.Examples of Value\u00a0PerceptionFacebook like/reaction, Google's +1, Reddit Gold, and Twitter's\u00a0repostingExamples of Transition\u00a0AssistanceT.

Note that these reputation values can only be linked to a specific session, but not to a specific user (as they have authenticated\u00a0anonymously).When the user comes back and starts a new session at the service, the service provider challenges the user to prove in zero-knowledge that he is not linked to any of the offending sessions (those that have a negative reputation associated). Zero-knowledge proofs allow the user to prove this, without revealing their identity to the service provider. Different, alternative proofs have been proposed, e.g. prove that the user is not linked to any of the sessions in a set of session IDs, prove that the last K sessions of the user have good reputation,\u00a0etc.In practice, more complex blacklisting rules can be applied as well. For instance, several reputation scores can be assigned to the same session, each regarding different facets of the user behaviour. Then, the blacklisting thresholds may take the form of a Boolean combination or a lineal combination over individual session and facet reputation\u00a0values.A service provider wants to prevent users who misbehave from accessing the service anymore, without gaining access to their\u00a0identity.Different implementations may only be practical for services with a reduce number of users, require intense computations, limit the scope of the reputation to a constrained time frame, be vulnerable to Sybil attacks, etc. Nonetheless, protocols are being improved to overcome these and other issues. See the cited sources below for the specific\u00a0discussion.A wiki allows any visitor to modify its contents, even without having been authenticated. Some malicious visitors may vandalize the contents. This fact is signalled by the wiki administrators. If a visitor coming from the same IP address keeps vandalizing the site, they will earn a bad reputation, and their IP will be banned from modifying the contents anymore.

However, this is not\npossible since users cannot completely avoid executing these actions\nbecause they need to perform them to achieve a goal (e.g., search for\na word on the Internet, send an email, search for a\u00a0location).Since the action must be accurately performed, an option to provide\nprivacy is to simultaneously perform other actions in such a way that\nthe adversary cannot distinguish real and fake (often called dummy)\u00a0actions.To hinder the adversary\u2019s ability to infer the user behavior, as well\nas her\u00a0preferences.This pattern entails the need for extra resources to perform the dummy\nactions, both at the side of the user that must repeat the action, and\nat the server side that must process several actions. Sometimes it may\ndegrade the quality of service since the service provider cannot\npersonalize services. It has been demonstrated that generating dummies\nthat are perfectly indistinguishable from real actions (in terms of\ncontent, timing, size, etc...) is very\u00a0difficult.Alice wants to search for an abortion clinic on Google, but she does\nnot want to reveal her intentions of abort to an adversary that may be\neavesdropping this search (e.g., ISP provider, system administrator of\nher workplace,\u00a0etc).The use of this pattern has been proposed to protect privacy in\nlocation based services (the user reveals several locations to the\nservice provider so that her real location is hidden), anonymous\ncommunications (the user sends fake messages to fake recipients to\nhide her profile), web searches (the user searches for fake terms to\nhide her real\u00a0preferences).", "tags": "", "title": "use of dummies"},{"url": "/patterns/Buddy-List", "text": "Contact List, Address\u00a0BookUsers frequently interact upon various media, forums, and communication channels. There are however far more users on these channels than most would be comfortable wading through. As controllers for such channels, many services wish to aid their users in finding familiar and comfortable interactions. Users may also seek to participate outside their immediate circles, but may aim not to stray too\u00a0far.When many users are able to interact in the interaction space, it is hard to maintain an overview of relevant interaction partners since the number of users exceeds the number of relevant contacts for a specific user. User lists grow very large and it is hard to find people who the local user knows. On the other hand, the local user is [more interested in close\u00a0contacts].A service aims to provide users with shortcuts to interaction with users who they are most likely to interact with within a particular context (close contacts within social\u00a0circles).Allow users to find and assign others to a user-maintained directory of social circles and contexts to interact with. This is optionally only visible to the users\u00a0themselves.Users should be able to view the Buddy List on demand, either during a search operation or persistently. They should be able to add or remove users from the relevant list with minimal\u00a0effort.The list may be seen as a set of user objects. This buddy list has the possibility of adding or removing user objects. In the first case, whenever the local users interact with another user, they can add the other user to their buddy list. To reach this goal, in the user interface, the local users can select the representation of the another user and execute a command for adding (e.g. a menu item associated to the user object). For removing users, when the buddy list is shown, the local users can select the representation of the another user and execute a command for removing (e.g. a menu item associated to the user\u00a0object).The Buddy List may fuse with other common interaction idioms to constitute a more comprehensive approach to the problem, making it more than an\u00a0idiom.Connecting the means for adding users to the buddy list with the user\u2019s representation (or the interface elements that are used to interact with the other user) makes the process of adding a user to the buddy list intuitive and reminds a user to consider adding the\u00a0user.By using the Buddy List to make connections about the user, the service can recommend relevant contact\u00a0suggestions.If users only consider buddy lists for maintaining contacts to other users, they will hardly find new users in the system. Thus you should ensure that users can also browse other users who are not on their buddy list (e.g. by providing a User\u00a0Gallery).The service can trivially derive the social structure of its userbase which may put trust at\u00a0jeopardy.Based\u00a0on:T.

Many users, instead, want to freely choose what information they share. This pattern recommends that services Support Selective Disclosure, tailoring functionality to work with the level of data the user feels comfortable\u00a0sharing.Controllers aim to design services to be both maintainable and extensible, though as a result blanket strategies are used to simplify designs. Users are individuals and do not always respond the same way to different approaches. Restricting user choice on processing displeases users, and bundling purposes for that processing conflicts with international law. Users want a service which works without the data they do not want to provide, even so far as effectively anonymous\u00a0usage.Controllers typically want to collect data by default, and tend to limit the diversity of their services, and the choices they provide, to encourage that. This goes against the best interests of the users, who have varying data collection\u00a0tolerances.The underlying issues are discussed in more detail\u00a0below.Controllers are tempted to see consent as all-encompassing, see held personal data as data available for use, and the lack of that data as a barrier to service. This mindset reduces adoption of the offering and may introduce a lack of\u00a0trust.This problem is also present when users register for or acquire a service, as unnecessary information is often requested as part of the process.  In the case of account registration users are often provided with inappropriate default settings. They are typically sent additional offers by default as well. The negative implications of these defaults are also not necessarily reversible, as the Internet is notorious for its inability to\u00a0forget.Services tend to collect a surplus of information, especially in contexts where monitoring is integral to the system, such as in productivity tracking. This unnecessary level of detail results in negative experience factors for the tracked individuals (for e.g. increased levels of anxiety) which in a work environment may affect their actual\u00a0productiveness.Determine what information is integral to the functioning of the system. If functionality may be sustained with less, it should be an option for the user, even if doing so comes with reduced usability. Additionally, provide anonymous functionality only where it cannot jeopardise the service. Lower levels of anonymity may be provided in relation to various capabilities for\u00a0abuse.At one extent it may be possible to benefit from the system anonymously, though whether this is feasible will depend on the level of abuse anonymous usage might attract. Alternatively, this can be approached from the perspective of revocable privacy. That is, tentative or eroding anonymity. If this would result in an unsustainable business model, however, a re-balance of usability may be\u00a0sufficient.It is important to note that while anonymous usage might not translate into direct profit, additional contributors and positive public perception may increase overall user activity. Furthermore, there are payment methods which support [some level of] anonymity if\u00a0necessary.Where users choose to register, it should not be assumed that they wish to use all of the system's services. Short of explicitly opting for 'best experience settings' (with sufficient explanation; not the default option), user preferences should default to the most privacy-friendly\u00a0configuration.User decisions should be amendable. For example, an agreement to share activity with another user may not carry over to all future usage. A user may decide to share something once in a while, or share regularly, but not always. The system should be able to account for this behaviour if it aims to prevent mistaken\u00a0actions.In situations where there are requirements for personal data, particularly when strict, users should be aware of this prior to their consent. These services should also not be coupled with other services holding lower requirements unless it would be infeasible not to. Where users are required to use the system, no unnecessary information should be used. In a productivity tracking example, this may mean that users are only identified when their productivity falls, or perhaps if they opt to receive credit for their\u00a0work.Due to increased control over their data, users may be able to share pieces of information which they otherwise wouldn't due to it otherwise being coupled with what they perceive to be more\u00a0sensitive.Users will be less likely to mistakenly release personal information to the public, since they would perhaps be able to set their own defaults, or by default stay private. To a further extent, users may be capable of participating or benefiting from a system anonymously. Where this is the case, the activity levels of the system will benefit, and users who stayed anonymous due to mixed feelings about the system may decide to register and authenticate later, once trust has been\u00a0built.The system's complexity will increase by a certain degree, as not only will each user need to have their preferences set, stored, and adhered to, but also services will need to account for variable inputs. As such, flaws in the system will be felt with greater\u00a0effect.Providing anonymity for some contexts may result in increased undesired behaviour, depending on the level of anonymity provided. Anonymising a service often requires additional processing power, especially in the case of revocable\u00a0privacy.By separating functionality according to purpose and personal data needed, as well as providing variations where feasible, the system will be more complex. Services will need to be designed while taking into consideration the potential for limited access to\u00a0data.Improvements to results may therefore be limited as well. However, the controller may be able to gauge adoption in data-rich services while they are investing in them. The same holds for determining how valuable non-invasive alternatives are, as users will express their [in]tolerance for invasiveness through their\u00a0actions.S. Ahern, D. Eckles, N. Good, S.

These masses of users and shared content are also varied enough to discourage individual attention. Controllers prefer to protect themselves from additional complexity and investment into features which provide them with less data.

For controllers providing this service (or product), worthless information does not typically generate income or future participation. Without consistent usage, a service becomes less popular and eventually may run at loss. This is particularly true in socially oriented services. To keep the service working, it is crucial that its users maintain content. Users however, might not feel inclined to do so. Keeping content up to date, or adding it in the first place, requires effort, and in some cases an acceptance of privacy\u00a0risk.Users do not necessarily want to provide and maintain content, they need a motivation to do so. Without this, a service will not\u00a0flourish.Provide users with different kinds of benefits when they contribute or maintain content for the service and make sure they do so\u00a0consensually.Depending on the kind of service that is provided, different benefits could be considered: virtual or real currency, use of services, social benefits, and so\u00a0on.When using virtual or real currency, the controller should first define how much in value users would receive depending on the contributions. In the case of virtual currency, the places where the currency could be used should be\u00a0defined.Regarding use of service, some criteria could be considered non-exhaustively: feedback on content, frequency of contributions, the use of service for a minimum duration, access to a service earlier than others, or use of special features within the\u00a0service.When users reach a limit, they could additionally assist with virtual or physical events for learning, meeting people, etc. In virtual scenarios, users could receive attention (feedback) from one\u00a0another.Based\u00a0on:T.

In these situations the quality and frequency of content affects the success of the service, and thus users have a large impact on its survival. Whether any single user contributes, or not, plays a role in profitability, which puts the controller in a position to encourage or enforce equal participation. Users may respond to such ideas negatively, however, especially if they do not see potential gains worthy of their effort and personal risks to\u00a0privacy.Equal participation does not always result in equal rewards. In some cases, participants do not need to contribute at all to benefit from the content generated by the group. Any who feel slighted are then likely to contribute less, eventually jeopardizing results for the\u00a0group.Limit the benefits gained from the group effort to the amount of effort contributed.

Prohibit people to benefit from group results if they are not willing to help the group in\u00a0return.Prior to completing designs on functionality, determine the benefits as opposed to efforts or costs on all possible user activities. Weigh these, with input from any necessary stakeholders. Any feature which does not affect more than one user does not need to be\u00a0assessed.For user groups that are able to affect one another within a feature or functionality, consider them each a case for a collaboration mode. If a user within this group performs an activity, they are expected to reciprocate on any benefits (or gain from costs). This is in proportion to the weighted effort of the feature determined\u00a0earlier.The way in which users reciprocate is up to specific implementation. It may include required effort (satisfied by certain activities) before their activity's resulting benefit is realized. Alternatively it may prevent additional beneficial activities until they contribute. It may also make their discrepancy public, allowing the users to determine tolerable thresholds. In all these cases it is useful to keep track of each user's ratio within each collaboration mode they\u00a0feature.It is important that any use of user data is done so under the explicit and properly obtained permissions required.
